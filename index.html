		<p>
		The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from India. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl). Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called as hen.
		</p>
		<p>
		Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia,but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.

		Beef is the culinary name for the meat obtained from cattle, specifically mature cows or steers. It is one of the most popular and widely consumed meats worldwide. Beef is known for its rich, savory flavor and versatility in various cuisines around the world.Today, beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world after pork and poultry.Brazil, Australia, the United States and India accounted for roughly 61% of the world's beef exports.
		</p>
		<p>
		Genetic studies in beef cattle are aimed at understanding and improving various aspects of cattle breeding and production. These studies involve the examination of the genetic makeup of cattle populations to identify genes associated with desirable traits, such as meat quality, growth rate, disease resistance, and reproductive efficiency.Key areas of genetic research in beef cattle includes selective breeding,genomic selection,genetic diversity,disease resistance and meat quality.
